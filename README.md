# YI QR Code Generator

This was quickly hacked together by a guy who doesn't really do frontend development as a way to both learn VueJS and to reverse engineer something for lols.

# What is it?

This will generate a QR code that Yi camera devices can read. 

# Does it work?

Probably not. The Bindkey is important to bind the device to the application/account and I've not reverse engineered that yet.

# Did you even test it?

Haha. No.

# Why is it so ugly?

Feel free to submit a PR to make it look pretty. It works though, right?

# Disclaimer

There is no warranty what so ever with this.
